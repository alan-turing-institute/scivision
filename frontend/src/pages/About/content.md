The Scivision project is building:

-   A [community](/scivision/community) of computer vision practitioners in the sciences and humanities
-   A **catalog** of community-curated computer vision [models](/scivision/model-grid) and [datasets](/scivision/datasource-grid) from the sciences and humanities
-   A **software ecosystem** of interoperable tools and utilities for working with computer vision models and data including [Scivision.Py](/scivision/scivisionpy) and [Pixelflow](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/pixelflow).
