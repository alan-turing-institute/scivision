This dataset is the same as the Sentinel-2 dataset, except the JP2K files were converted into Cloud-Optimized GeoTIFFs (COGs). Additionally, SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog metadata has were in a JSON file alongside the data, and a STAC API called Earth-search is freely available to search the archive.
