The task involved adding pre-trained models and datasources to the scivision catalog. Succesful submissions include two classification models, for flowers and butterflies, and related datasets.\n#### Notebooks:\n- [Butterflies](https://github.com/scivision-gallery/connections-workshop-examples/blob/main/ButterflyClassification.ipynb)\n- [Flowers](https://github.com/scivision-gallery/connections-workshop-examples/blob/main/FlowerClassification.ipynb)\n\nTo learn more about the REG at Turing, click [here](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-engineering)",

      "page": "Plankton plays an essential role in the global carbon cycle and carbon sequestration, regulating the exchange of carbon dioxide between the atmosphere, surface ocean and ultimately the seabed. Plankton is also used in global monitoring efforts providing reliable and sensitive indicators to climate change and ecosystem health.\n\nAs part of a Data Study Group (DSG) challenge organised between the Alan Turing Institute, the Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (CEFAS) and Plankton Analytics Ltd (see [here](https://www.turing.ac.uk/events/data-study-group-november-2021)), the participants contributed in the use of pretrained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with a ResNet-50 architecture to improve the accuracy of plankton classification at finer taxonomic levels compared to a baseline Random Forest (see the full report [here](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/publications/data-study-group-final-report-centre-environment-fisheries-and-aquaculture)).\n\n## Example notebook\n\nThere is a worked example of the Plankton Classification model in action available at [the Scivision Gallery](https://github.com/scivision-gallery/plankton-classification).\n\nIn this notebook, we demonstrate how scivision facilitates the discovery of one of the trained ResNet-50 CEFAS DSG models for classifying plankton images into three classes: copepod, non-copepod and detritus. We pair the model with one of the matched data sources from the scivision data catalog, in this case a relatively small sample of images (n=26) extracted from the full test set (N=5863) used during the DSG challenge.",
