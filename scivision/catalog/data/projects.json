The task involved adding pre-trained models and datasources to the scivision catalog. Succesful submissions include two classification models, for flowers and butterflies, and related datasets.\n#### Notebooks:\n- [Butterflies](https://github.com/scivision-gallery/connections-workshop-examples/blob/main/ButterflyClassification.ipynb)\n- [Flowers](https://github.com/scivision-gallery/connections-workshop-examples/blob/main/FlowerClassification.ipynb)\n\nTo learn more about the REG at Turing, click [here](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-engineering)",

Plankton is also used in global monitoring efforts providing reliable and sensitive indicators to climate change and ecosystem health.\n\nAs part of a Data Study Group (DSG) challenge organised between the Alan Turing Institute, the Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (CEFAS) and Plankton Analytics Ltd (see [here](https://www.turing.ac.uk/events/data-study-group-november-2021)), the participants contributed in the use of pretrained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with a ResNet-50 architecture to improve the accuracy of plankton classification at finer taxonomic levels compared to a baseline Random Forest (see the full report [here](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/publications/data-study-group-final-report-centre-environment-fisheries-and-aquaculture)).\n\n## Example notebook\n\nThere is a worked example of the Plankton Classification model in action available at [the Scivision Gallery](https://github.com/scivision-gallery/plankton-classification).\n\nIn this notebook, we demonstrate how scivision facilitates the discovery of one of the trained ResNet-50 CEFAS DSG models for classifying plankton images into three classes: copepod, non-copepod and detritus. We pair the model with one of the matched data sources from the scivision data catalog, in this case a relatively small sample of images (n=26) extracted from the full test set (N=5863) used during the DSG challenge.",

[Rogers et al. (2021)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01431161.2021.1897185?journalCode=tres20) advance in coastal vegetation monitoring by developing `VEdge_detector`, a tool to extract the coastal vegetation line from remote-sensing imagery, training a very deep convolutional neural network (holistically nested edge detection), to predict sequential vegetation line locations on annual to decadal timescales. The `VEdge_Detector` model was trained using Planet 3 – 5 m spatial resolution imagery. It has also detected vegetation edges in Landsat and Copernicus Sentinel imagery, although performance is not guaranteed. The tool cannot detect the vegetation edge in aerial imagery.\n\n# Example notebook\nThere is a worked example of the VEdge_Detector model in action available at the [Scivision Gallery](https://github.com/scivision-gallery/coastalveg-edge-detection).\n\nIn this notebook, we demonstrate how scivision facilitates the discovery of the VEdge_detector model for differentiating between the coastal vegetation edge and other boundaries in remote sensing images. We pair the model with one of the matched data sources from the scivision data catalog, in this case some sample of satellite images (n=3) from different geographical areas (Suffolk, United Kingdom; Wilk auf Föhr, Germany; Varela, Guinea Bissau) provided within the VEdge model repository."
