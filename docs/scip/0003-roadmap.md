## Description

This document summarises the main priorities of the Scivision team
based at the Alan Turing Institute, for the current phase of the
project supporting Scivision development, that started in January
2023.

Scivision originated at the Alan Turing Institute, and development is
actively hosted there, but the project welcomes participation from
anyone in the wider community. Any contributions related to
Scivision's mission are gladly received, whether or not they relate to
the items noted below.

This roadmap is to be understood as listing areas that are likely to
receive attention from the Turing team, and is provided in order to
help users and contributors understand the direction of the project,
given the Turing team's stake in it.

Importantly, the roadmap doesn't commit anyone to any particular
deliverables, there aren't specific dates associated with the items
listed here, and it may be modified (it is likely to remain a
perpetual 'draft').

## Priority areas

### Core features

  - Data loaders (potentially replacing or supplementing Intake)
  - Catalog schema improvements and model/datasource metadata; catalog
    versioning
  - Better specified requirements for models and datasources
  - More robust handling of model dependencies

### Community engagement

  - Running events, including a regular community call
  - Making Scivision a hub for best practices in sharing reproducible
    CV models
  - Informational videos (overview, getting started, task-focussed
    tutorials)
  - Informal support to researchers wishing to share their models and
    datasets

### Web interface

  - Model/dataset matchmaking, graphical representation of models and
    dataset interoperability
  - Improved 'model cards'
  - Improvements to the 'new model/new datasource' interface
  - A community calendar

### Automation

  - 'Cookie cutters' for model repositories
  - Consistency/integrity checks, including
      - URLs in the catalogs
      - scivision gallery notebooks (from current scivision projects)
      - checked annotations (decorators)

### Supporting Scivision use-cases

  - Support to researchers at the Turing and collaborators
  - Growing the catalog
    - Helping users to share their models and data through the catalog
    - Targetting good coverage of:
      - object tracking
      - super-resolution
      - shape analysis
