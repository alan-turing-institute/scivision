It is recommended that you first read the information on how to [submit a datasource](https://scivision.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing.html#preparing-a-dataset-for-inclusion-in-the-catalog)), and how to ensure your [datasource is in the correct format](https://scivision.readthedocs.io/en/latest/data_repository_template.html)).


## Details

<!-- Please add a brief description of the dataset when opening the issue -->



## Process checklist

<!-- These tasks to be addressed after opening the issue - when the dataset has been added to the catalog, the issue can be closed. -->

(More details can be found in the links above)

- [ ] Data is publicly accessible with a stable link (and suitably licenced)
- [ ] Optional: The data has an associated Scivision data yml file (or data loader/plugin)
- [ ] Catalog metadata .json file created using https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/scivision/new-datasource
- [ ] Thumbnail image created

Then you have two choices (select the one you will follow):
- [ ] Attach the .json file and the thumbnail to this issue. If you choose to do this, a scivision maintainer will open a PR on your behalf to add the dataset to the catalog. They will notify you when that has been done.
- [ ] Open a PR, and add the .json file details / thumbnail to the datasource catalog, as described in https://scivision.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing.html#manual-steps-for-adding-a-dataset. Request a review from the Scivision maintainers.
